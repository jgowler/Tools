# Tools

This repo contains all the tools I have created using Python. Most will be inspired by work tasks to help automate or otherwise speed up processes.

## EntraGrapher

This tool takes an Entra ID .csv file and allows you to select one of the preconfigured templates and plot the data to a graph. Will also show a sample of the .csv file in a table once uploaded for a quick check.

## event-viewer.exe

This tools was created to allow the easy export of Event Viewer logs in Windows. You select the date range, the log name, and the log level then select a save location and the .csv will be created.
