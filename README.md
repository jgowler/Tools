# Tools

This repo contains all the tools I have created using Python. Most will be inspired by work tasks to help automate or otherwise speed up processes.

## entra-graph.exe

This tool takes a .csv file and allows you to select the X and Y axis to plot out a graph in a selection of styles. As this app is based around the Entra ID logs in Azure some templates have been provided which will automatically plot out a graph of that description.

## event-viewe.exe

This tools was created to allow the easy export of Event Viewer logs in Windows. You select the date range, the log name, and the log level then select a save location and the .csv will be created.
